In Death in Space there are four abilities: **BODY (BDY)**, **DEXTERITY (DEX)**, **SAVVY (SVY)**, and **TECH (TEC)**. When player characters attempt to do something that needs a dice roll, roll a d20 and add your relevant ability score to the roll.

To roll for a new character's ability scores, roll 2d4, one at a time. The result is the first roll minus the second. Then rinse and repeat until you have a result for all four abilities.
Example 1:
	First roll = **4**
	Second roll = **2**
	Result = **2**

Example 2:
	First roll = **1**
	Second roll = **4**
	Result = **-3**

# (OPTIONAL) Extended Abilities
This is an experimental system meant to add depth to abilities by adding at least 5 **specializations**
to every ability. These specializations work much in the same way as proficiencies do in 5e, where player characters can choose to specialize in certain things. As it stands, this is still WIP but might be used if it gets fully fleshed out.
