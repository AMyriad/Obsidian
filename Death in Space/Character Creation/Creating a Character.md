**THE SANDS OF TIME** swirl in anticipation. Years ago - perhaps decades, perhaps, centuries - your character came into being from the great nothing. The world is vast, society splintered by their own ambitions across a cold and distant sea of nothing. Now, just as this world shaped you throughout your years of life, you've now been charged with the power to shape it as well.

Will you live to rise in this great void, or screaming, bear alone a grave *DEATH IN SPACE?*
