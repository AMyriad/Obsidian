## Health Points and Defense Rating

All creatures have **health point (HP)** and **defense rating (DR)** values.

> HP signifies how many hits a thing can take before breaking or dying.

> DR signifies how good a thing can prevent hits, whether by dodging the attack or being too durable to be affected.

New characters start with **1d8 maximum HP**. When you rest, you recover **1d8 + BDY**.
All characters have **12 + DEX DR** by default, without armor.
#### Body Parts

Humans have **6** body parts: **two arms**, **two legs**, the **torso**, and **head**.

**Limbs** (everything except the torso) each have their own **HP**, totalling the creature's **max HP**.
This means **each limb's max HP is 1/4th the creature's max HP, rounded down**.

-  - **Example:**
- *Max HP:* 37
- *Limb Max HP:* 37 / 4 = 9.25 â‰ˆ 9
