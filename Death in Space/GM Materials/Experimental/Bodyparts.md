### Bodyparts
Humans have **6** bodyparts: **two arms**, **two legs**, the **torso**, and **head**.

**Limbs** (arms and legs) each have their own **HP**, totalling the creature's **max HP**.
This means **each limb's max HP is 1/4th the creature's max HP, rounded down**.

  **Example:**
- *Max HP:* 37
- *Limb Max HP:* 37 / 4 = 9.25 â‰ˆ 9

Limbs are also harder to hit **(+1 DR)** with ranged attacks, owing to the skill needed to hit a specific bodypart.

**When a limb takes damage it does not affect the creature's max HP**. But if the limb's HP is reduced to zero, it becomes broken or **dismembered**.


### Dismemberment
While your limbs may be harder to hit, losing one will heavily cripple you!

> Losing an **arm** 


Actions page:

Then optionally choose the [[LIFE AND DEATH#Bodyparts|bodypart]] you want to focus. *(You default to targeting the torso if nothing is specified)*
Remember, your target gets +1 DR if you're trying to hit one of their [[LIFE AND DEATH#Bodyparts|limbs]].
