Combat test no. 1 puts the players in a contract to ferry a mining ship back to the Iron Ring from Rimtursar. When they arrive, their client's ship is already in pieces.

=={THEY WERE FOUND IN A FIGHT WITH NO WINNERS // THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT}==

Due to a trap left behind in the area or an environmental hazard, the engines to the players' ship are completely broken. There are enough parts in the wreckage to restore them, but repairs will take some time. What's worse, the wreck has attracted the attention of a crew of marauders.

=={A DISTRESS CALL WAS SENT OUT // THEY WERE TRAILING THE SHIP AT LONG-RANGE}==

The player crew has 24hrs before the marauder ship arrives.

Will they fortify their ship? Will they set a trap? Can they repair the engines in time before they arrive? Will they make it out with the mining ship's holos and ore? And will they defeat the marauders, bargain with them somehow, or suffer a worse fate?
