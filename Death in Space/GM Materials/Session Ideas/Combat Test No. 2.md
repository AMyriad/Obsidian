Combat test no. 2 is a follow-up to the first test, depending on its outcome.


> DID THE PLAYERS MAKE IT OUT ALIVE IN THEIR SHIP?

This test then puts the players on a different crew, contracted to hunt down a mining ship before it gets back to the Iron Ring from Rimtursar. They are informed their target is being ferried by an escort, and that caution is advised.

> DID THE MARAUDERS SUCCESSFULLY KILL AND RAID THE PLAYERS?

This test then puts the players on another crew, intercept a ship holding stolen goods from a previous M.I.A. client before it escapes. Said client's security detail sent an emergency distress signal ~8hrs ago, claiming marauders boarded their ship and left with the cargo they were assigned to protect. There were no survivors.
